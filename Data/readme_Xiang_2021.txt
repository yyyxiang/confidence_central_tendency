Stimulus: The stimuli were arrays of black dots on a white background. The number of dots ranged between 15 and 65.

Confidence scale: Discrete scale from 0 to 10. 0 indicates "Guessed randomly", 10 indicates "Very confident".

Manipulations: The stimulus duration on each trial was either 100 ms or 2000 ms, intermixed randomly within each block; each of the two duration conditions appeared on half of the trials on each block.

Block size: 40 trials on each block, 6 blocks in total.

Feedback: No feedback.

NaN fields: Participants had 10 s to type in their estimate using the number pad on the keyboard. NaN indicates that a participant failed to respond in time.

Subject population: General population.

Response device: Keyboard and mouse.

Experiment setting: online.

Training: 10 trials prior to the experiment. Not included in the data file.

Special instructions: For each participant, the average stimulus magnitude within each block was randomly drawn from a discrete uniform distribution on the integers from 30 to 50 (sampled without replacement). For each block, the within-block distribution was a uniform distribution centered at the average stimulus magnitude, ranging between Â±15 (sampled with replacement). Participants were informed about the average stimulus value within a block at the beginning of each block, before making any estimates. Participants were encouraged to use the full range of the confidence scale. Participants had the opportunity to earn a performance-based bonus payment if their estimate on a randomly chosen trial was within 2 of the stimulus magnitude.
