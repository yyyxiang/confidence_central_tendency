		Please consider this information carefully before deciding whether to participate in this research.
	</p>
	<p>
		<b>Purpose of the research: </b>
		To examine the way people make decisions and learn about the relationships between stimuli, estimate, and confidence.
	</p>
	<p>
		<b>What you will do in this research: </b>
		Stimuli (arrays of dots) will be presented on the screen and you will be asked to report the number of dots you see and your confidence level regarding your report.
	</p>
	<p>
		<b>Time required: </b>
		Participation will take 30-40 minutes to complete.
	</p>
	<p>
		<b>Risks: </b>
		You may get tired during the experiment. You can pause and rest after every block.
	</p>
	<p>
		<b>Benefits: </b>
		This study provides no benefits to you individually. The study provides important information about the nature of learning and decision making. Others may benefit in the future from the results of this study.
	</p>
	<p>
		<b>Compensation: </b>
		You will receive a base payment of $4.5 and a possible bonus payment of $1 via Amazon Mechanical Turk for completing the entire experiment.
		Your eligibility for bonus payments depends on your performance. One trial will be randomly selected after completion. If your response on that trial is within 2 of the true stimulus, you will receive a bonus payment.
		If you fail the comprehension check at the start of the experiment, however, you will receive a payment of $0.5 only.
